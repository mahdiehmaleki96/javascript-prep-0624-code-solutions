## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  It determines whether the loop should continue executing or terminate. If the condition evaluates to true, the loop executes its block of code. If the condition evaluates to false, the loop stops.
- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  The initialization expression is evaluated once at the beginning of the for loop, before the loop starts. It is typically used to declare and initialize the loop control variable.
- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  The condition expression is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the loop executes its block of code. If the condition is false, the loop terminates.
- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  The final expression is evaluated at the end of each iteration of the loop, after the loop's block of code has been executed but before the next iteration begins. It is usually used to update the loop control variable.
- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  The purpose of the final expression is to update the loop control variable, ensuring that the loop progresses toward its termination condition and does not result in an infinite loop.
- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
